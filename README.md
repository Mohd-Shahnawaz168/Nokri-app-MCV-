# Job Search Application App

Technologies: Node.js, Express, express-ejs-layouts, express-session, MVC, Nodemailer, JavaScript

Developed a Job Search and Application application where users can search and apply for jobs, and admins can manage job postings. The application uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern for structured development and Nodemailer for email notifications upon job applications.

1 Built the backend using Node.js and Express to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and provide a clean separation of concerns through the MVC architecture.

2 Stored user and job data in local files (JSON or flat-file storage) instead of a database, allowing the app to function without the need for a database system.

3 Implemented user authentication and authorization, where users can apply for jobs and admins can manage job listings (add, update, delete jobs).

4 Integrated Nodemailer for email notifications, so the admin is alerted whenever a user applies for a job, providing a seamless and automated process.

5 Designed a role-based system: users can view job listings and submit applications, while admins can create new job postings and manage the list of available positions.
